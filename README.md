# bootstrap-grid-float-fix
Simple fix for floated grid elements of varying sizes (using inline-block)

Changes the grid elements to inline-block which allows us to alleviate the annoying float issues when elements flow over to a new row.


Usage:
Add '@import "col-fix";' to your bootstrap.scss file
